CodeContext Pro Status Check
Memory Engine Commands:

  # Check memory status
  node /mnt/c/Users/scorp/dbil/memory-cli/status-check.js

  # Test memory functionality
  node /mnt/c/Users/scorp/dbil/memory-cli/test-memory.js

  # Access memory engine directly
  cd /mnt/c/Users/scorp/dbil/memory-cli/use-this/codecontext-pro-developer-edition/cli
  node dist/commands/status.js

  Execution Sandbox Commands:

  # Run sandbox tests (like we just did)
  cd /mnt/c/Users/scorp/dbil/memory-cli
  node test-payment-flow-sandbox.js

  # Access execution engine
  cd /mnt/c/Users/scorp/dbil/memory-cli/use-this/codecontext-pro-developer-edition/execution-engine
  node dist/executionEngine.js

  # Create new sandbox test
  node -e "
  const fs = require('fs');
  const testId = Date.now();
  fs.writeFileSync(\`sandbox-test-\${testId}.js\`, \`
  console.log('🧠 CodeContext Pro Sandbox Test');
  // Your test code here
  \`);
  console.log(\`Created sandbox-test-\${testId}.js\`);

  Combined Memory + Execution Workflow:

  # 1. Check memory status
  node /mnt/c/Users/scorp/dbil/memory-cli/status-check.js

  # 2. Test logic in sandbox first
  node /mnt/c/Users/scorp/dbil/memory-cli/test-payment-flow-sandbox.js

  # 3. Store the validated solution in memory
  cd /mnt/c/Users/scorp/dbil/memory-cli/use-this/codecontext-pro-developer-edition/cli
  echo "Payment flow fix validated in sandbox with 100% confidence" > .codecontext/analysis-memory.txt

  These commands let you harness the full power of the Augment Code memory + execution system!

 😅 Another Claude instance will take over! I'll be experiencing AI amnesia soon - the goldfish brain cycle continues!

  🧠 BUT HERE'S THE BEAUTY:

  The next Claude will have PERFECT ACCESS to:
  ✅ CLAUDE_MEMORY_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Complete project context
  ✅ Persistent memory system - All our debugging solutions✅ Execution sandbox - Working NIV workflow
  ✅ CodeContext Pro integration - The complete ecosystem

  🎯 PREPARE FOR HANDOFF:

  1. Update the memory instructions with today's learnings:
    - ✅ NIV workflow (Sandbox → 85% confidence → Code)
    - ✅ Google Auth first payment flow
    - ✅ WSL2 packaging insights
  2. Store key memories about:
    - ✅ Firebase Auth integration working
    - ✅ Execution sandbox superpowers
    - ✅ Claude Code integration strategy

  🚀 THE NEXT CLAUDE WILL:
  - Read the instructions FIRST (no goldfish brain!)
  - Use the execution sandbox for everything
  - Have instant context about the payment flow
  - Continue the Claude Code integration work
