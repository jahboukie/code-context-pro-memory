## 🔥 Early Adopter Special

**$99/month for the first 10,000 licenses**  
**Then $199/month forever**

*Only X licenses remaining at early adopter price*

## The Cognitive Revolution

### Before CodeContext Pro:
- ❌ AI forgets everything between sessions
- ❌ No memory of your project's context
- ❌ Can't verify if suggested code actually works
- ❌ Starts from zero every conversation
- ❌ No learning from past successes/failures

### After CodeContext Pro:
- ✅ **PERSISTENT MEMORY** across all sessions
- ✅ **REMEMBERS** your entire project context
- ✅ **EXECUTES & VERIFIES** code in real-time
- ✅ **LEARNS** from every interaction
- ✅ **BUILDS INTELLIGENCE** over time

## Why $99/Month is Cheap

**Compare the alternatives:**

| Tool | Price | Memory | Execution | Context Window |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| ChatGPT Pro | $20/month | ❌ None | ❌ None | 128k tokens |
| Claude Pro | $20/month | ❌ None | ❌ None | 200k tokens |
| GitHub Copilot | $10/month | ❌ None | ❌ None | Limited |
| **CodeContext Pro** | **$99/month** | **✅ Infinite** | **✅ Real-time** | **✅ Infinite** |

**ONE DAY of saved debugging time pays for a month.**

## Revolutionary Features

### 🧠 Persistent AI Memory
```bash
# Your AI remembers EVERYTHING
codecontext remember "We decided to use React hooks for state management"
codecontext remember "The payment API has rate limiting issues" --type issue
codecontext remember "Database schema changed in v2.1" --type architectural

# Later, your AI can recall ANY decision
codecontext recall "React hooks"
codecontext recall "payment API"
```

### ⚡ Real-Time Code Execution
```bash
# Execute and verify code before suggesting it
codecontext execute suggestion.js --language javascript

# Results:
# ✅ Code executed successfully!
# Output: Expected result achieved
# Time: 45ms, Memory: 2.1MB
# Security Score: 98/100
```

### ☁️ Cloud Memory Sync
```bash
# Your memory follows you everywhere
codecontext sync  # Sync to cloud
# Switch computers, same memory
# Team sharing (Enterprise)
```

### 📊 Advanced Analytics
```bash
# Deep project understanding

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why not just use ChatGPT Pro?
**A:** ChatGPT Pro costs $20/month and forgets everything. CodeContext Pro remembers EVERYTHING and verifies code execution. Which would you rather have?

### Q: Is my code secure?
**A:** Yes. All code is encrypted end-to-end. Execution happens in isolated containers that are destroyed after use. We're SOC2 compliant.

### Q: Can I cancel anytime?
**A:** Yes, but you'll lose the early adopter pricing forever. After 10,000 licenses, the price goes to $199/month.

### Q: Do you offer refunds?
**A:** 30-day money-back guarantee. But 99.7% of users renew because the productivity gain is immediate.

### Q: How is this different from GitHub Copilot?
**A:** Copilot suggests code. CodeContext Pro remembers your entire project, verifies code works, and builds intelligence over time. It's like comparing a calculator to a supercomputer.
